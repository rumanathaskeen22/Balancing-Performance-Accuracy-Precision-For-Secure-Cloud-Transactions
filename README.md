# Balancing-Performance-Accuracy-Precision-For-Secure-Cloud-Transactions

Operating System:
 Windows-8.0
Technologies:
   ASP.NET with C#
Database:
   MS-SQL server
Project Description:  We define several different levels of policy consistency constraints and corresponding enforcement approaches that guarantee the trustworthiness of transactions executing on cloud servers.
We propose a Two-Phase Validation Commit (2PVC) protocol that ensures that a transaction is safe by checking policy, credential and data consistency during transaction execution.
